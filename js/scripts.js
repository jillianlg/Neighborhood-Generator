// Test Driven Development:
  // Test: returns a range of numbers from 0 to the users inputted number.
  // Input: 5
  // Output: "0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5"
  
  // Test: splits the user inputed number from a string of numbers to a range of individual strings.
  // Input: 5
  // Output: "1","2","3","4","5"

  // Test: will identfy all "3" and convert them to "Won't you be my neighbor?".
  // Input: 13
  // Output: "1","2","Won't you be my neighbor?","4","..."12", "Won't you be my neighbor?"

  // Test: will identfy "12" and convert it to "boop"
  // Input: 12
  // Output: "1","2","3"..."10","11","Boop"

  // Test: will identfy all "2" and convert them to "boop" unless the inputed number includes a combinded number such as "23" or "32".
  // Input: 12345
  // Output: "1","Boop","3","4","5"

  // Test: will identfy all "1" and convert them to "beep", unless the inputed number includes combinded number such as "12" or "13".
  // Input: 5
  // Output: "Beep","2","3","4","5"

  // Test: will allow user to clear results and imput a new number
  // Input:
  // Output:
